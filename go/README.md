# Go API Server for swagger

DRAFT API specification for provisional term request management for an ontology. An instance of the API is attached to a particular ontology, and configured on the back-end to interface with the tooling surrounding that ontology. Therefore, information does not have to be given through the API as to location of Ontology/GitHub/Wiki instances for term addition.

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen]
(https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.
